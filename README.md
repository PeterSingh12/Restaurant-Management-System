1.	Introduction
1.1	Purpose 
The purpose of this document is to specify the requirements for a Restaurant Management System (RMS). The RMS will manage daily operations such as order processing, table reservations, billing, staff management, and inventory tracking. This SRS defines the functional and non-functional requirements for the software and is intended for developers, testers, and stakeholders.
1.2	Document Conventions
• Functional requirements are labelled as REQ-x.x.
• High priority requirements are marked as [H], medium as [M], and low as [L].
• UML diagrams and tabular notations are used for clarity.
1.3	Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions
• Developers: Implement features based on functional requirements.
• Testers: Verify functionality and performance against requirements.
• Managers: Track project scope and progress.
• End-users (staff): Understand basic system capabilities.
1.4	Product Scope
The Restaurant Management System will streamline restaurant operations by integrating multiple functions—order management, billing, reservations, and inventory—into one application. It will improve efficiency, reduce manual errors, and enhance the customer dining experience.

1.5	References
• IEEE SRS Template (Karl E. Wiegers, 1999).
• UML standards (Object Management Group).
• POS (Point of Sale) best practices.

2.	Overall Description
2.1	Product Perspective
The RMS is a standalone system that integrates with POS terminals, kitchen displays, and optionally, online ordering portals.
2.2	Product Functions
• Table reservation and seating management.
• Menu browsing and order placement.
• Billing and payment processing.
• Inventory management and low-stock alerts.
• Staff management (roles, shifts, access levels).
• Reporting (daily sales, expenses, popular items).

2.3	User Classes and Characteristics
• Admin/Manager: Full access, manages staff, inventory, and reports.
• Waiter/Staff: Takes orders, updates status, generates bills.
• Chef/Kitchen Staff: Views and updates order status.
• Customer (optional online module): Reserves tables, places orders.

2.4	Operating Environment
• Web-based or desktop system with optional mobile support.
• Windows/Linux OS, MySQL/PostgreSQL database, browser support (Chrome, Firefox).
2.5	Design and Implementation Constraints
• Must support concurrent users.
• Database must handle real-time updates.
• Secure payment gateway integration.
2.6	User Documentation
• User manual (staff/admin).
• Online help and FAQ.
• Training videos for staff.
2.7	Assumptions and Dependencies
• Stable internet connection required for cloud version.
• Payment integration depends on third-party gateway APIs.
3.	External Interface Requirements
3.1	User Interfaces
• Login/registration page.
• Dashboard for Admin/Staff.
• Menu display and order screen.
• Billing interface with payment options.
3.2	Hardware Interfaces
• POS terminal, printers for receipts.
• Tablets/mobile devices for waiters.
3.3	Software Interfaces
• Database: MySQL/PostgreSQL.
• Payment Gateway APIs.
• Web browser for web version.
3.4	Communications Interfaces
• HTTPS for secure communication.
• API calls for payment and online ordering modules.
